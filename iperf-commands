IPERF - https://iperf.fr/

iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. 
It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6). 
For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters. 
This is a new implementation that shares no code with the original iPerf and also is not backwards compatible.

Install Iperf on Ubuntu
You can use apt-get install to install Iperf in Ubuntu.
<b>apt-get install iperf</b>

Start server
To start Iperf in server mode, use the below command.
<b>iperf -s</b>

Start server in daemon mode
Running the server without daemon mode keeps the process running in the terminal. Use the -D switch to run it as a daemon in the background.
<b>iperf -s -D</b>

Connecting to server from client
Iperf needs to run on the local host in client mode, as well as in server mode on the remote host. To connect to the remote host, add itâ€™s IP address after the -c switch.
<b>iperf -c 10.1.1.50</b>

Change the port
You must use the same port on both the client and the server for the two processes to communicate with each other. Use the -p switch followed by the port number to use on both the local and remote host.
<b>iperf -c 10.1.1.50 -p 9000</b>
<b>iperf -s -p 9000</b>

Change the test duration
The default test duration of Iperf is 10 seconds. You can override the default with the -t switch followed by the time in seconds the test should last.
<b>iperf -s -t 60</b>

UDP instead of TCP
The default protocol for Iperf to use is TCP. You can change this to UDP with the -u switch. You will need to run both the client and server in UDP mode to perform the tests.
<b>iperf -s -u</b>
<b>iperf -c -u</b>

Run multiple threads
Iperf can spawn multiple threads to simultaneously send and receive data. Use the -P switch followed by the number of threads to use.
<b>iperf -c -P 4</b>
